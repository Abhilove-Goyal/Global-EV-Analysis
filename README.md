### **Project Highlights**
#### **1. Historical Insights**
- Analysis of EV sales and stock trends from 2010 to 2024, highlighting the growth trajectory of the global EV market.
- Key findings:
  - **China**: Leading in EV sales with strong policy mandates like the NEV subsidy and quotas.
  - **Europe**: High EV adoption driven by stringent emission standards and widespread incentives.
  - **USA**: Growth attributed to federal tax credits and state-level policies.
  - **India**: Emerging player with initiatives like FAME II focusing on electric two-wheelers and infrastructure.

#### **2. Predictive Analysis**
- Time series forecasting using the **Prophet** model to predict:
  - **EV Sales Share**: Projected to reach 70% for new vehicle sales globally by 2034.
  - **Stock Share**: Gradual rise reflecting the transition from traditional ICE vehicles.
- Comparative forecasts for major regions to assess market potential and growth.

#### **3. Policy Evaluation**
- Analysis of government interventions, comparing:
  - Subsidies and incentives.
  - Charging infrastructure development.
  - Emission standards and mandates.

#### **4. Visual Insights**
- Dynamic visualizations showcasing:
  - **EV Sales Trends**: Historical trends in global EV sales across major countries, helping to identify growth patterns.
  - **Stock Shares**: Regional comparisons of stock shares and market penetration of EVs, highlighting the progress and potential growth in different regions.
  - **Forecasted Growth**: Time series forecasting of EV sales share and stock share for the coming years (2025–2035), providing future projections based on historical data and government policies.

The project also includes **detailed visualizations** to compare the impact of various **government policies** on EV adoption across regions like China, the USA, Europe, and India. These visualizations are key to understanding the relationship between policy interventions (such as subsidies, tax credits, and emissions standards) and EV adoption rates.

Additionally, a comprehensive **Word document report** is included, summarizing:
- The **methodology** used for data analysis and forecasting.
- A **comparison** of the EV market strategies employed by different countries and how these strategies have influenced market success.
- **Insights** into the effectiveness of government policies and how they could be leveraged to boost EV adoption in emerging markets.

This report serves as a valuable resource for stakeholders, policymakers, and researchers looking to understand the key drivers of the global EV market.
